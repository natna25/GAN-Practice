# GAN-Practice
collection of tutorial notebooks on Generative Adversarial Networks.

These examples were taken and slightly adapted from the website "https://machinelearningmastery.com/".

The author of the blog recently started publishing lots of articles on bulding GANs.

He plans on compiling these tutorials into a book along with a lot of commented code examples. His tutorials are very clear and usually well documented and explained. Most of the code here is verbatim from his tutorials although I occasionally added some extra functions to explore the domain a little bit.

Here is the list of the articles which I have implemented and plan to implement:

## 1) Basic 1D GAN

## 2) MNIST GAN

In this one, I added a function to record the training process of the GAN in order to have an interesting looking animation to see the training process.

## 3) GAN for generating CIFAR10 images

## 4) Conditional GAN

In this example, I modified the code to work with the CIFAR10 dataset

## 5) Exploring the GAN latent space
